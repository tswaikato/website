    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p class="text-justify ml-5 mr-5">Our training focus's around leadership and will challenge you to lead your peers
      to
      achieve tasks. To compliment this leadership focus we train do activities such as
      Camping,
      Tramping,
      Sailing & Powerboats,
      and Range shooting
      During your time as a cadet you will likely also visit Defence Force bases and partake in ceremonies where you
