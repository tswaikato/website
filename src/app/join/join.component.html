                begin at
                the bottom and over time move their way up the ranks. This gives real world experience to managing
                people, a
                skill that is greatly sought after by employers in the future and something that the school system
                doesn’t
                actively offer. After 2 – 3 years involved cadets will spend time confirming the skills they have
                learned
                through a week long course typically held at a defence establishment, this course is full paid by the
                defence
                force. </p>

                We use sailing to promote and encourage team work, this is done via weekend exercises and also competing

                During
                their time in Cadets they will likely partake in many range days and have the chance to competitively
                shoot.
                NZCF are only authorised to shoot .22 rifles and only at circular targets on closed / Defence Ranges. In
                some
                instances, Cadet may also be invited to participate in shooting exercises with NZDF directly but only if
                they
                can demonstrate sound understanding of the rules. </p>
